Perfect! I've implemented a complete solution for persistent message storage that works across all users on GitHub Pages. Here's what I've added:

✅ Cross-User Message Persistence Solution:
🌐 JSONhost.com Integration

External Storage: Uses JSONhost.com service for persistent JSON storage
Cross-Platform: All users see the same updated messages
Real-time Updates: Changes are immediately saved to the cloud
Fallback System: Uses default messages if server is unavailable

🔧 Setup Instructions
The editor now includes setup instructions:

Create JSONhost.com Account: Go to jsonhost.com and upload your JSON file
Get JSON ID: Copy the JSON ID from the admin interface
Get API Token: Get your API Authorization token from the settings
Update Code: Replace these placeholders in the code:
javascript
const JSONHOST_API_KEY = 'your_api_token_here';
const JSONHOST_JSON_ID = 'your_json_id_here';

Redeploy: Push changes to GitHub Pages

💾 Enhanced Save Features

Server Sync: All saves/deletes sync to JSONhost.com
Visual Feedback: Shows saving progress and success/error states
User Notifications: Clear confirmations for cross-user impact
Error Handling: Graceful fallback if server is unavailable

🚀 Benefits

Universal Updates: Admin edits appear for all users instantly
No Database Needed: Perfect for GitHub Pages static hosting
RESTful API: Simple GET/POST requests for data management
Persistent Storage: Messages survive page reloads and deployments
Easy Setup: Simple API key configuration

⚠️ Current Status
Until you set up JSONhost.com:

✅ Edit functionality works locally
❌ Changes only affect your browser session
⚠️ Other users won't see your message updates

Once configured, all users will see real-time message updates! 🎯✨

Next Step: Set up your JSONhost.com account and replace the placeholder API credentials in the code.

// JSONhost configuration for persistent storage
const JSONHOST_API_KEY = 'w1he0onjv4fssfinwxquhoxif3z1llcw'; // Replace with your JSONhost API token
const JSONHOST_JSON_ID = '1a167691ed974abc8def5c4d486b7a23'; // Replace with your JSON ID from JSONhost

Initial JSON Structure for JSONhost:
    {
        "messages": [
            "📅 Last date for fee payment: 31st March 2025 | 💰 Late fee charges applicable after due date",
            "📋 Submit original documents by 15th April 2025 | 🏛️ Visit college office during working hours",
            "🎓 Final semester exam registration opens 1st May 2025 | 📚 Ensure all dues are cleared before registration"
        ],
        "lastUpdated": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "updatedBy": "SMP Admin"
    }
